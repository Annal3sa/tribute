  <P> Kaito Momota is from Danganronpa V3 Killing Harmony. He is known as the ultimate astronaut. He calls himself Luminary of the stars. He has a condtion that causes him to cough up blood. And yes its blood not Pepto Bismol Koa. Anyways he is a very inspiring character. He's one of my favortite characters from the thrid game. He has a catchphase and it is "The impossible is possible, all you gotta do is make it so". He killed Kokichi Oma duting the 5th chapter. He was then excecuted but it failed and Kaito died because of his condition, making Monokuma mad.</P>

 <p>The girl in the red in the picture above is Maki. Maki developes feelings for Kaito and He developes feelings for her. The would've been a perfect couple if he didn't die. Anyways the guy in the middle is Shuichi and you play as him throughout the game. Shuichi was one of Kaito's best friends during the game. At one point, Kaito wanted Shuichi to be his sidekick.</p>
